## Win32APILibrary v2\.0


</div>

### Description

Totally rewritten the library and added new functionality, including network drive mapping and SMTP email (still working on this as i can't get it to work 100% of the time). Please vote for this code as it gives me the encouragment to improve it and to add new features.
 
### More Info
 
You need to know how to reference a DLL, once youve done that the library is pretty well laid out and self explanatory.
